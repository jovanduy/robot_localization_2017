### Bag Files
#### These our the bag files for the Robot Localization Project.

The first two were provided for us, ac109_1.bag and ac109_2.bag. We used these for the development of our particle filter. 
We took the third localizer.bag, to use with a map we made ourselves.

##### The final two our bags of our particle filter.
The bag labeled new_particle_filter is a bag file of our particle filter running with the later version of our update_particles_with_laser implementation outlined in our writeup. 
The bag labeled original_particle_filter is of our particle filter running with our original implementation. 

We took both of these so we could have the opportunity to compare their performances.
